 Implementations of basic Data Structures in Python


TODO:
Refactor the following as classes:
-arrayPractice.py -> rename: array
-LinkedListPractice.py -> rename: LinkedList
-queue.py -> rename: Queue
-stack.py -> rename: Stack

Make a Wrapper Program to demonstrate each class. Similar to DatabaseDemo.
